## Run the project in the browser

In the project directory:

* The command `npm start` - will run the app in the development mode
* Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

## Task
Using React JS build a front-end application that allows a user to calculate compound interest on their investment over years.

Information about compound interest can be found here:
https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/finance/compound-interest-formula.php

This includes a working equation that can be used in your application.

#### Requirements

- Setup a React application
- A user should be able to input 3 values:
- Starting value (principal)
- Interest rate
- Years
- On submit the user should see the value of their investment after the number of years
they input
- UX and styling is completely up to you, however, this is not a design test so an
unstyled output is completely acceptable

#### Notes

- Donâ€™t worry about compound interest multiple times a year, we will assume just once
- Only allow for compound interest to be calculated by years, there is no need to give
an option for months
- How you design and implement this React app is up to you
- You can setup a local React application and push to Github or you could even do this
in something like JSbin
- This is purely a front end application so no data needs to be persisted to a database
or local storage
